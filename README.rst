====================================
My Command-Line Environment

Tmux.

Zsh
===

I use Prezto for my Zsh environment. Prezto was originally forked from
Oh-My-Zsh. I have my own fork with some customizations at
`<http://github.com/cordarei/prezto/>`_\ .


Git
===

My `.gitconfig` defines colors and my preferred editor. It also has some
old aliases which are obsoleted by Preztoâ€™s git module. I have a
git_template directory with hooks for running etags; for more info see
`<http://tbaggery.com/2011/08/08/effortless-ctags-with-git.html>`_\ .


Tmux
====

Tmux is much better than screen; I recommend switching unless you are
simply a screen god.
