! Reassign Caps Lock to generate Control, LCtrl to generate Escape, and the
! Escape key to generate Caps_Lock
!

! We have to remove both Caps_Lock and Control_L modifier mappings
! because xmodmap won't remap to the new keycode if the mapping already
! exists (I think).

remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Control = Control_L

keycode 66 = Control_L
keycode 9 = Caps_Lock
keycode 37 = Escape

add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
